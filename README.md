Edible Gardens Mapp
========

Edible Campus is a program of the North Carolina Botanical Garden that creates working landscapes across the UNC Chapel Hill campus to facilitate student engagement in topics of food and agriculture sustainability.

This project is an interactive UI that maps each garden in google maps and contains information about gardens, plants, and recipes. This repository contains the frontend built in ReactJS and relies on an API built on Express JS. The project is deployed  on Redhat's Openshift at http://react-ui-dept-botanicalgarden.cloudapps.unc.edu
